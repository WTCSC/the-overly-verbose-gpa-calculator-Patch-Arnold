# üìö GPA Calculator

This Python script calculates your overall GPA, analyzes semester performance, and checks whether your GPA goal is achievable by improving your grades.

# üöÄ Features

Calculates your overall GPA from a list of grades

Lets you analyze first or second semester performance

Compares your semester GPA to your total GPA and gives feedback

Lets you set a goal GPA (1.0‚Äì4.0) and checks if you can reach it by improving grades

# üíª How It Works

The program starts with a list of grades stored as strings:

grades_not_floated = ["3.5", "4.0", "2.7", "2.2", "3.9", "1.3"]

It converts those to floating-point numbers and calculates:

The total GPA (average of all grades)

The semester GPA, depending on whether you pick semester 1 or 2

You‚Äôre asked which semester to analyze:

Which semester do you want to analyze?

First semester - first half of classes

Second semester - second half of classes
Enter 1 or 2:

The program calculates your semester GPA and prints whether it‚Äôs higher or lower than your overall GPA.

Finally, you enter your goal GPA, and the program checks whether it‚Äôs possible to reach that goal by changing one or more grades to 4.0.

# üß† Example Output

Calculating... beep boop... Your GPA is: 2.933333333333333
Which semester do you want to analyze?

First semester - first half of classes

Second semester - second half of classes
Enter 1 or 2: 1

Your first semester GPA is 3.4
Your total GPA is 2.93
Your total GPA is more than your first semester GPA, time to hit those books!


# üß© Goal GPA Logic

After you enter your desired goal GPA (from 1.0 to 4.0), the program simulates raising each grade to 4.0 one at a time.
If the goal GPA can be met that way, it tells you how many grades you‚Äôd need to raise.
Otherwise, it reports that it‚Äôs not possible with just one grade change.

# üß∞ Requirements
